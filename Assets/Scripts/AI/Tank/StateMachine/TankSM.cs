/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Reflection should be used cautiously due to its performance overhead and the loss of compile-time type safety.
/// It is slower compared to direct access via properties, methods, or fields since it involves runtime type inspection.
/// Moreover, reflection can lead to less maintainable and harder-to-debug code, as it bypasses standard access
/// mechanisms and encapsulation principles.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// * Performance: Reflection is considerably slower than direct field access, impacting application performance.
/// * Encapsulation: It bypasses access modifiers, potentially breaking encapsulation and leading to unintended consequences.
/// * Maintainability: Code using reflection can be less readable and harder to maintain, especially for developers unfamiliar with it.
/// * Type safety: Reflection bypasses compile-time type checks, increasing the risk of runtime errors.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Instead of reflection, it is recommended to use classical getters and setters or public properties to access
/// and manipulate field values. These provide better performance, type safety, and allow for encapsulation.
/// Reflection may be useful in scenarios where dynamic type access is required, such as in frameworks or libraries,
/// but should be avoided in general application logic.
